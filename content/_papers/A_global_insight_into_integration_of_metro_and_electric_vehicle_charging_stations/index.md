abstract: This study investigates the potential of park-charge-ride (PCR) worldwide in the era of transportation electrification, covering 153 urban study units across the United States, Europe and China. This research uses a set of spatial analysis methods to profile the proximity, density, and clustering patterns of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and parking lots relative to metro stations. The results reveal several substantial regional disparities. The United States demonstrates strong yet uneven PCR implementation with remarkable EVCS aggregation; Europe reaches balanced improvement of PCR services; and China, though possessing the greater metro infrastructure, demonstrates limited EVCS integration metro stations nearby. Intriguingly, the study found no significant policy-driven prioritization of PCR deployment by several types of metro stations (i.e., normal, interchange, terminal). These findings stress the necessity for spatial planning to optimize the coverage of PCR, foster multimodal transport efficiency, and advance sustainable mobility objectives worldwide.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study reveals substantial regional disparities in park-charge-ride integration around metro stations across the US, Europe, and China, underscoring the need for targeted spatial planning to advance sustainable mobility.

**Highlights**

<ul>
  <li>A global geodataset of EV charging stations (EVCS) and metro stations is provided. </li>
  <li>The U.S. leads in EVCS aggregation near metro stations, yet development is uneven. </li>
  <li>Europe shows balanced co-development of parking facilities and EVCS. </li>
  <li>China shows strong potential to upgrade park-and-ride to park-charge-ride services. </li>
</ul>
