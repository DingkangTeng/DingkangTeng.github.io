**Abstract**

Rural residential land is a crucial component of the three key reforms in land policy. While ensuring the mandatory protection of the red line of 1.8 billion mu of cultivated land and addressing the demands of urbanization, industrialization, and balanced urban-rural development, the withdrawal of idle and surplus rural residential land holds significant importance for protecting cultivated land resources and effectively supplying land for urban construction. This paper conducts an investigative study using Yicheng, Hubei, China as a case study, involving visits and surveys across 4 towns and 10 villages to explore farmers’ willingness to withdraw from residential land and the factors influencing it. The findings offer feasible suggestions for local governments in formulating policies related to rural residential land reform.
